Hello!
Let me take you through my experience during this Independent Study.

# Initial:
* In my independent study I worked with Shivendra Agarwal who's research focuses on assistive technology. He is working on
smart cane which uses T265+D455 camera setup for creating a vision for blind people.
* I helped him create different ios apps which will help him make a complete application for use.
* This was my first experience with ios development which was good and kind of challenging for me.
